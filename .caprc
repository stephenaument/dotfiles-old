# .caprc - Capistrano configs (added by deprec gem [www.deprec.org])
#
# Include settings that you want active whenever you use Capistrano
# You can over ride these for particular projects by putting entries
# into Capfile or deploy.rb for those projects
#
# Uncomment any of the following entries to enable them.

# Include deprec - deployment recipes for Capistrano (www.deprec.org)
#
# This loads all recipes minus the ones in rails.rb
# The recipes in rails.rb add 'before' and 'after' tasks to
# some of the builtin cap deploy tasks which are not appropriate
# for deploying a project that isn't setup to use deprec.
#
# require 'deprec_minus_rails'

# This fixes the following problem on Ubuntu Lucid (and others?)
#  'sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified'
#
default_run_options[:pty] = true

# Load ruby scripts from our ~/.recipes directory to make their
# tasks available to Capistrano whenever cap is invoked.
Dir[File.join ENV['HOME'], '.recipes', '*.rb'].each do |tasks|
